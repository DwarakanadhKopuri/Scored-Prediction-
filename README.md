# Football player model
- We created two models using game data in each league. Frist model is to check what factor is critical for player's rating. As using the model, it can predict their rating based on a single game data. Second model is that finding better position based on training data. The second model is based on about 2,500 players having a single position. Then, it will be used for helping other players having multi positions find their better position.

## 1. Crawling game data

## 2. Player rating model
- Comment : I think that if we have more past season data, I am sure we can get some significant insight about changes of main factors on each position and on the overall football strategy/style.

### 2-1) FW

### 2-2) MF


### 2-3) DF

## 3. Position recommend model
